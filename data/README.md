## Datasets

This repository contains datasets and related materials for usage in my exploration. 

- **fbc_data_codebook.csv:** Codebook providing information on variables in the fbc_data dataset.
- **fbc_data.rds:** RDS file containing the main dataset (fbc_data).
- **raw:** Directory holding raw/original data files.

The original datasets located in the `raw` file:

**fbc_data_2022_raw.xlsx:** Original file for the main dataset collected from []()

**cost_of_living_us_raw.csv:** Original file for secondary dataset collected from []()

These were manipulated and used to help create my current version `fbc_data.rds` which includes two new variable in contrast to the original, `region` and 
`minimum wage`.
