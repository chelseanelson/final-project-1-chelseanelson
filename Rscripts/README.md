## Scripts

This directory contains R scripts for different stages of the data analysis process.


1. **0-data_collection_manipulation.R:** Script for collecting and manipulating data.
2. **1-univariate_analysis.R:** Script for conducting univariate analysis.
3. **2-bivariate_analysis.R:** Script for performing bivariate analysis.
4. **3-multivariate_analysis.R:** Script for preparing for my multivariate analysis.
5. **4-question1.R:** Script related to answering my first exploration question.
6. **5-question2.R:** Script related to answering my second exploration question.
8. **6-codebook.R:** Script for generating or updating the codebook.

## Usage

If you want to explore or run the code, I would recommend starting with `0-data_collection_manipulation` and then running through each of the rscripts from there in order to get a feel of my thought process and see how 
I went about exploring the data, as well as being able to connect your own 
explorations as well.

## Acknowledgments

I have already called any external libraries in `0-data_collection_manipulation` file if needed throughout looking through your exploration. As well as I have called for the main dataset in that file already to be used.
