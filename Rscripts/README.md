## Scripts

This directory contains R scripts for different stages of the data analysis process.


`0-data_collection_manipulation.R` : Script for collecting and manipulating data.

`1-univariate_analysis.R` : Script for conducting univariate analysis.

`2-bivariate_analysis.R` : Script for performing bivariate analysis.

`3-question1.R` : Script related to answering my first exploration question.

`4-question2.R` : Script related to answering my second exploration question.

`5-codebook.R` : Script for generating or updating the codebook.

## Usage

If you want to explore or run the code, I would recommend starting with `0-data_collection_manipulation` and then running through each of the rscripts from there in order to get a feel of my thought process and see how 
I went about exploring the data, as well as being able to connect your own 
explorations as well.

## Acknowledgments

I have already called any external libraries in at the beginning of each R file if needed throughout looking through your exploration. As well as I have called for the main dataset in each file already to be used.
