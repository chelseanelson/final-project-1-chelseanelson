- **data:** Contains datasets used in the analysis.
- **figures:** Stores visualizations and figures generated during the analysis.
- **rscripts:** Holds R scripts used for data analysis and processing.

## Documents

- **Nelson_Chelsea_executive_summary.html:** Executive summary document in HTML format.
- **Nelson_Chelsea_executive_summary.qmd:** Quarto source document for the executive summary.
- **Nelson_Chelsea_final_report.html:** Final project report in HTML format.
- **Nelson_Chelsea_final_report.qmd:** Quarto source document for the final project report.
- **Nelson_Chelsea_progress_memo_1.html:** Progress memo 1 in HTML format.
- **Nelson_Chelsea_progress_memo_1.qmd:** Quarto source document for progress memo 1.
- **Nelson_Chelsea_progress_memo_2.html:** Progress memo 2 in HTML format.

## Project Files

- **final-project-1-chelseanelson.Rproj:** RStudio project file for easy project management.

## Usage

If you want to explore or run the code, I would recommend starting with `rscripts/0-data_collection_manipulation` and then running through each of the rscripts from there in order to get a feel of my thought process and see how 
I went about exploring the data, as well as being able to connect your own 
explorations as well. However, if you would just like a quick overview of my analyses, I would recommend reading through both `Nelson_Chelsea_progress_memo_1.html` and `Nelson_Chelsea_progress_memo_2.html` as well as `Nelson_Chelsea_final_report.html` for a complete overview of my analyses,
from start to finish, If you would just like a quicker overview of the main 
insights generated from my analyses, I would recommend reading through 
`Nelson_Chelsea_executive_summary.html` as that is a short executive summary of all the work and insights that I gained from my exploration. 

## Acknowledgments

I have already called any external libraries in `rscripts/0-data_collection_manipulation` file if needed throughout looking through your exploration. 

All references to external sources and information used have been highlighted and can be found in the References section of `Nelson_Chelsea_final_report.html`.
